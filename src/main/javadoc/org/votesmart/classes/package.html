The classes package has the classes that the user is going to typically need.

Each of the classes should be constructed with no arguments. 

Calls to the classes methods then call the api and return the
results in one of the data package classes.

The queries will be cached and all subsequent calls will return 
the same information. If you want to disable the cache checking, 
then call VoteSmart.checkCache(false); or VoteSmart.checkCache(true);
to turn it back on.
