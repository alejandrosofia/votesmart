These classes implement the calls to the API. 

The user will typically use the classes package.

<p>It requires a ResourceBundle named VoteSmart. This means a file
named votesmart.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This VoteSmart client reads two 
keys from the resource bundle, one of which is mandatory.
These are in the form of key=value, one on each line.
The keys are:<br/><br/>

apikey		(Mandatory) get and APIKEY from VoteSmart.org<br/>
cache		(Optional) such as c:/tmp/VoteSmartCache<br/>
</p>

<pre>For Example:
apikey=123easyasabcbabyyouandme
cache=c:/tmp/votesmart
</pre>

<p>
 The queries will be cached and all subsequent calls will return 
 the same information. If you want to disable the cache checking, 
 then call VoteSmart.setCache(false); or VoteSmart.setCache(true);
 to turn it back on.
