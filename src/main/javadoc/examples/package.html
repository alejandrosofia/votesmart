This program is a very simple demonstration of this RESTful Client API.
It requires a ResourceBundle named VoteSmart. This means a file
named VoteSmart.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This VoteSmart client reads three 
keys from the resource bundle, two of which are mandatory.
These are in the form of key=value, one on each line.
The three keys are:

apikey    (Mandatory) get from VoteSmart.org
cache     (Mandatory) such as c:/tmp/VoteSmartCache
loglevel	 (Optional) NONE, SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST, ALL

The basic goal here are to make (most) every possible call 
and use ID's from earlier calls to pass to later calls.

Secondarily, the goal is to list make all the calls that can be 
made for a state.

The example.java program is this:

// Query the server
CandidateList candidates = new OfficialsClass().getByOfficeState("6", "MT");

// And print out the candidates
for ( CandidateList.Candidate candidate: candidates.candidate ) {
	System.out.println(
		candidate.candidateId 
		+ " = " 
		+ candidate.title
		+ " "
		+ candidate.firstName
		+ " "
		+ candidate.lastName 
	);
}
