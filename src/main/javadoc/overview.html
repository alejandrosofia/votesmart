<p>This program is a RESTful Client API for the <a href="http://votesmart.org">VoteSmart.org Website.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.votesmart.org/docs/">VoteSmart Documentation</a> site has 
additional information and terms of use.</p>

<p>The typical user will typically use the classes in the org.votesmart.classes package.</p>

<p>Java version 1.6 at a minimum is required. No additional jars are required.</p>

<p>It requires a ResourceBundle named VoteSmart. This means a file
named votesmart.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This VoteSmart client reads two 
keys from the resource bundle, one of which is mandatory.
These are in the form of key=value, one on each line.
The keys are:<br/><br/>

apikey		(Mandatory) get and APIKEY from VoteSmart.org<br/>
cache		(Optional) such as c:/tmp/VoteSmartCache<br/>
</p>

<pre>For Example:
apikey=123easyasabcbabyyouandme
cache=c:/tmp/votesmart
</pre>
<p>
 If caching is enabled, the queries will be cached and all subsequent 
 calls will return the same information. If you want to disable the cache checking, 
 then either omit the cache key from the properties file, or 
 call VoteSmart.setCache(false) to turn it off and VoteSmart.setCache(true);
 to turn it back on.
